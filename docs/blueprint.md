## Style Guidelines:

- Scheme: Dark. Drawing inspiration from modern fintech and growth, the palette provides a professional and trustworthy feel against a deep background.
- Primary color: A vibrant, clear Emerald Green (#26DD89) signifying efficiency, growth, and security. It offers strong visibility against the dark background.
- Background color: A subtly tinted, very dark almost-black (#0A0F0C), derived from the primary green hue, providing a sophisticated 'slate-950' like aesthetic.
- Accent color: A lighter, fresh Mint Green (#7AE07A) for interactive elements, highlights, and secondary calls to action, providing clear visual contrast.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for its modern, clean, and objective aesthetic, ensuring high readability across all data-intensive dashboards and transactional views.
- Utilize Lucide icons throughout the application, ensuring a consistent, sharp, and minimalist visual language for all functional elements.
- Adopt a responsive, mobile-first layout. Incorporate glass morphism design principles for cards and panels with rounded corners to create depth and a modern fintech feel.
- Implement subtle transition animations on card interactions, modal displays, and chart rendering to enhance user experience without distraction.
